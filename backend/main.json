            "desc": "The recent release of the Tanzania Economic Update, a biannual report published by the World Bank, provided insights into some of the economic developments the country has undergone over the last few years. With a GDP growth above the Sub Saharan average, quantified at 4.6% in 2022, Tanzania’s economy has clearly shown resilience and recorded a modest post-pandemic recovery. A number of key matters are a priority in the short- and medium-term to maintain the country’s economic status. These include strengthening capacity to further build resilience, supporting inclusive growth through the Private Sector, and enhancing the investment climate to boost both domestic and foreign investment.In a discussion of the country’s investment climate and development outlook, members of the CEO Roundtable of Tanzania (CEOrt) and The World Bank Country Director Mr. Nathan Belete outlined recommendations for boosting business performance and maintaining national growth. This thought leadership session was one of the CEOrt’s monthly engagements for members which facilitate dialogue on various issues critical to Tanzania’s sustainable development. The discussion involved a panel discussion that included Mr. Belete, Ms Ilse Boshoff - Regional Director at KNAUF TANZANIA, Mr. Jose D. Moran - Tanzania Breweries Limited (TBL PLC) Managing Director, Mr. Theobald Sabi, FCCA - NBC Tanzania Managing Director and Mr. David Tarimo -  Country Senior Partner at PwC Tanzania and CEOrt Board Chairman. While the World Bank works predominantly with governments, Mr. Belete voiced his organisation’s belief in the business community, stating that developing countries, which have seen significant growth have moved forward with strong support from the Private Sector.",
